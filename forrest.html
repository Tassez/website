		<h3>Degree Project - education center with temporary living</h3>
		<p>For.rest is an education center and temporary living for 
		the nature preserve, in partnership with Airbnb, with the goal 
		of awakening the preciousness of nature. Through looking close 
		up how nature was affected by the extensive fire, observing how
		life will returns to the forest as it recovers, and revisiting 
		for natureâ€™s recovery. For.rest helps visitors not only escape 
		from city life but also offers personal rejuvenation for those 
		that engage For.rest in a new way.</p>

        <p>In forrest, there are two different buildings, 3 day living 
		and learning center. It is surrounded by previously burnt forests
		where visitors can feel sadness because of all the dead nature,
		but then also feel of hope because they can see that it is 
		recovering and revisit later to see the difference of how it has
		recovered even more. </p>

        <p>People who grow up in large cities tend to get disconnected

		materials makes the contrast of inside and outside, the
		transition from sad to hopeful. Organic materials make
		the space feel more live, meaning that small creatures 
		are returning to this burnt area.</p>
